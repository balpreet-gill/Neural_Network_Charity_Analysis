# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
- A deep learning neural network is designed and trained, using python's tensorflow library. The model evaluates all types of input data and produces and clear decision-making result. Metadata about each organization is captured within the dollowing columns, in the dataset. 

## Results
### Data Preprocessing 
- 1. The "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column is the target, as it contains data on whether the donations were used effectively. 
- 2. Variable such as APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFLIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT are considered to be the features of the model. 
- 3. 80 neurons were in the first hidden layer and 30 neurons were in the second hidden layer. 
- 4. Target model performance was not achieved. 
- 5. In an attempt to optimize model performance, a third hidden layer was added. 

## Summary 
- The target performance was not achieved. In an attempt to optimize model accuracy, it is recommended to adjust the number of hidden layers and neurons.
